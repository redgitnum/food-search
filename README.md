## Food search app,

**App works thanks to the https://world.openfoodfacts.org API.**

## About
- App searches for any edible/drinkable product that is in the openfoodfacts DB and shows some details about each product that are found on the product package
- Everyone can contribute and add more products or fill missing information on https://world.openfoodfacts.org - just follow the instructions on site
- Build with react, used react-redux, redux toolkit and tailwind-css for styling
- React-redux with with redux toolkit for state management and API calls (which is overkill for this kind of app but I wanted to practice redux toolkit)
- App build/styled mostly for mobile/tablet use, it will work fine on desktop, just not very pretty
